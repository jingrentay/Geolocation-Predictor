This project is a machine learning predictor that uses image data from various sources such as Kaggle and other free databases to train the model in order to predict the latitude and longitude based on an uploaded image.

In model.py, we have revised multiple version of our ImageGPSModel to obtain better accuracy during each version while also expanding the locations to be included within the model. 

However, the accuracy is not the most accurate in terms of precisions but it does guess a good range of latitude and longitude of the uploaded image compared to the actual latitude and longitude of the image.
